ENTROPY TOKEN SALE TERMS
If you pay us what we ask for,
we promise to assign a number of Entropy Tokens to your address,
or return your unused payment to you.
These are the Terms.

Important Notice
* Do not apply or pay for Entropy Tokens unless you fully understand what you are
paying for and you accept the risks.

* Before applying, please read Entropy Foundation’s current Token Disclosure
Statement (TDS) for a summary of significant features and risks.
No disclosure document (including any white paper) can fully cover all features and
risks, so please carefully consider your situation before applying.
Entropy Foundation’s current TDS is on Entropy Foundation’s Website and may be
updated from time to time.

* The futures of HUT34, the Entropy Foundation and Entropy Token are highly
speculative.
There is no assurance of the future performance of any of them.
Participation in HUT34 and the Token Sale is targeted for developers. It is not
suitable for speculators or for financial investment.

* These Terms are binding on the offer we make to you and on the sale of Entropy
Token to you.
No other terms (whether written by you or us or implied) affect these Terms unless
they are mandatorily imposed by law and we cannot contract out of that.

* You can only apply for Entropy Token through our Website.
You must accept and agree to be bound by these Terms for your participation in the
Token Sale.
No-one other than Entropy Foundation is authorised to offer or to make
statements on behalf on behalf of Entropy Foundation. Guard against scams,
phishing and hackers.

* You are not offered any financial product, financial service or investment
opportunity.

Do not apply for Entropy Token for speculative financial gains.

There is no regulated disclosure document or token sale process applying to the
Token Sale.

If any country’s laws prohibit or specifically regulate any part of the Token
Sale under financial or securities laws, then no offer or sale may occur under
the Token Sale as far as those laws actually apply.
Entropy Foundation may cancel, limit, transfer or modify any step of the Token
Sale to ensure compliance with the Terms and any country’s laws.

Terms
1. Application of these Terms
1.1 These terms (as amended from time to time – see clause 17.18) exclusively govern the legal
relationship between you (Applicant) and Entropy Foundation in the Token Sale. This includes
receiving, controlling and holding Entropy Tokens and your use of the Website, subject only to
any law which cannot be excluded by these Terms.
1.2 The Token Sale includes the offer made to you, your application, our decision whether to
accept your application (in full or in part) and our completion of all accepted offers.
1.3 If you participate in the Token Sale, you will be deemed to have conclusively and irrevocably
accepted all of the Terms (without any counter-offer, amendment or ancillary agreements or
terms asserted by you). You cannot counter-offer or change these Terms. If you do not agree
to these Terms, then do not participate in the Token Sale.
1.4 Entropy Foundation controls the Token Sale. No other person represents or binds Entropy
Foundation in the Token Sale.
2. Timing of Token Sale
2.1 The Token Sale will begin at the Commencement Time and will end at the Closing Time. Those
dates (and times) will be specified on the Website.
2.2 Entropy Foundation may change the Commencement Time or the Closing Time in its absolute
discretion. Any such changes will be notified on the Website and will be effectively immediately
at the time of being published on the Website (without any other notice).
2.3 Entropy Foundation may in its absolute discretion end the Token Sale and may withdraw any
offers to allocate or to assign Entropy Tokens before the Closing Time (for clarity, without
having to amend the Closing Time or to give notice to anyone).
3. Website
3.1 Entropy Foundation may, in its absolute discretion and without giving prior notice:
(a) vary, modify, add or remove features, or amend any content on the Website; and
(b) block or restrict access to, or terminate, withdraw or suspend use of, the Website or any
part of the Website.
Those changes apply to you whether or not you continue to access or to use the Website.
No Entropy Foundation Person will be liable for any Loss which is incurred as a result of such
action.
3.2 Entropy Foundation may remove any user generated content from the Website:
(a) in its absolute discretion and without giving prior notice; and
(b) at the request of a user.
3.3 Entropy Foundation Persons are not responsible for, and will not be liable for, any user
generated content posted to the Website. Entropy Foundation Persons will not be liable for any
Loss arising from such content or from the failure of Entropy Foundation to moderate, delete or
correct any such content.
3.4 Entropy Foundation may arrange for the Website to accept registrations of interest in the Token
Sale. Any registration of interest is limited to a facility to advise registrants of the availability of
the Token Sale and to receive news and updates. It is not an application for Entropy Token and
gives no right to allocations to Entropy Tokens. All registrants are solely responsible for taking
the steps to apply for Entropy Tokens as set out on the Website (in accordance with these
Terms). (For clarity, such a facility to accept registrations of interest will be different from any
facilities for allocations prior to the public availability of the Token Sale.)
3.5 The Website may contain hyperlinks to websites which are not maintained or controlled by
Entropy Foundation. All hyperlinks to such websites are provided as a convenience to you.
Use of the hyperlinks and access to such websites is entirely at your own risk. No Entropy
Foundation Person is responsible for any third-party content contained in websites linked to the
Website. No Entropy Foundation Person is liable for any Loss arising from accessing, using or
relying on such websites.
3.6 The inclusion of any hyperlink does not imply endorsement by Entropy Foundation of such
websites. Entropy Foundation is not the partner, associate, agent or other representative of any
person who is named on the Website or whose trademark, service marks, logo, insignia or other
device is used on or appears on websites to which the Website is linked.
4. Token Sale
4.1 Applicant must apply to buy Entropy Tokens only through the Website.
4.2 By applying for Entropy Token through the Website, Applicant irrevocably agrees to these
Terms (as may be amended after their application in accordance with these Terms).
4.3 All applications for Entropy Token are irrevocable. They may not be withdrawn prior to the end
of the Token Sale with the express written consent of Entropy Foundation notified to Applicant.
4.4 Any applications which are not allocated in full or in part as at the end of the Token Sale
automatically lapse.
4.5 Entropy Foundation may terminate the Token Sale at any time, without notice, and regardless of
the amount of Entropy Tokens allocated.
4.6 Applicant’s application to buy Entropy Tokens is subject to Entropy Foundation’s sole discretion
to accept the application, in whole or in part.
4.7 Entropy Foundation will comply with all express written representations it makes on its Website
about the Token Sale. This includes, but is not limited to, caps on issuance, pricing and
allocation of Entropy Tokens.
4.8 The TDS does not provide any representation, warranty, undertaking, assurance or give rise to
any other conduct (or omission) which affects these Terms or which independently gives any
person any legal rights or expectations.
4.9 The fixed limit on the total number of Entropy Tokens is 100,000,000 Entropy Tokens. The limit
that will be generated will be referenced in the smart contract code for the Entropy Token. (see
clause 9.1.)
4.10 Applicant must pay Entropy Foundation for the number of Entropy Tokens applied for at the
price offered by Entropy Foundation and in the forms (including digicurrencies or fiat currencies)
notified on the Website. The offered price (as notified on the Website) may differ according to
the timing of applications and the number of Entropy Tokens applied for. Entropy Foundation
decides how to apply the pricing which is stated on the Website from time to time.
4.11 Applicant acknowledges that failure to follow the Token Sale instructions on the Website or any
difficulties in transferring payment may limit, delay, or prevent Applicant from applying for and
acquiring Entropy Tokens. Any questions about such instructions should be directed to
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9dfcf9f0f4f3ddf5e8e9aea9b3f4f2b3">[email protected]</a>
4.12 Entropy Foundation will pay Applicant, or return to the control of Applicant (as the case may be)
any amount of payment or other consideration which is in excess of the amount required to
settle Applicant’s payment obligation to acquire Entropy Tokens allocated to Applicant.
Applicant accepts that there may be delays or procedural issues in arranging payment to
Applicant due to third party systems (such as digicurrency exchanges or e-wallets).
4.13 There is no cooling off period on or after allocation of the Entropy Tokens to Applicant.
4.14 Allocation of Entropy Tokens to Applicant is irreversible and irrevocable. There is no refund or
compensation to Applicant for the number (if any) of Entropy Tokens allocated (or not allocated)
to Applicant.
4.15 Allocations of Entropy Tokens to Applicant will only be made in accordance with the details
provided by Applicant.
4.16 The only official and authorised Token Sale website URL operated by Entropy Foundation is
https://hut34.io/entropySale Applicant is solely responsible for ensuring that the URL of their
web browser indicates that it is using a hypertext transport protocol secure connection (“https”)
and that the domain name used by them is correct.
4.17 Entropy Foundation does not support or endorse any third party website or service which
accepts payment in relation to Entropy Tokens, provides Entropy Tokens during the Token Sale
or facilitates either of these things in any way during the Token Sale or at any time up to the
launch of HUT34. Entropy Foundation has no relationship in any way with such other parties or
services. Applicants are urged not to use any third party service which claims to offer such
services.
4.18 By participating in the Token Sale or receiving, controlling and holding Entropy Tokens, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that no other party (including, without limitation
any Entropy Foundation Person) may be held liable for any Loss arising out of, or in any way
connected to, your participation in the Token Sale or receiving, controlling and holding Entropy
Tokens in any manner other than via the Website.
4.19 By applying for and being allocated Entropy Tokens, to the extent permitted by applicable law
you may not hold any Entropy Foundation Person liable for any Loss arising out of, or in any
way connected to, your failure to secure properly and to keep private your email address and
any password or private key used in connection with the Token Sale. Applicant accepts the risk
that if Applicant does not maintain an accurate record of these, then Applicant will lose control
over or access to Entropy Tokens (without any compensation for that or any allocation or
transfer of substitute Entropy Tokens).
4.20 Entropy Foundation may arrange for offers, invitations and allocations of Entropy Tokens before
or during the Token Sale. Nothing in these Terms limits or prevents Entropy Foundation from
allocating Entropy Tokens, at different prices, and on different terms from these Terms.
5. Creation of Entropy Tokens
5.1 Entropy Tokens will be assigned to successful Applicants within 14 days after the day of the
Closing Time. (This period allows for reconciliation of applications and payments, resolving
payment details and for integrity reviews.)
5.2 For the purposes of the Token Sale, all Entropy Tokens assigned as a result of the Token Sale
will be publicly viewable at the Etherscan.io website (subject to continued maintenance of that
website by its owner).
6. Main purposes of Token Sale
6.1 The two main purposes of the Token Sale are to generate Entropy Tokens to be used in HUT34
and to receive payment for the assignment of those Entropy Tokens sold in the Token Sale.
6.2 The payment or other consideration received by Entropy Foundation for the assignment of
Entropy Tokens will be applied in its absolute discretion towards the development and
marketing of HUT34 and for general expenses of Entropy Foundation. No representation,
undertaking or assurance is given as to precise use or the timing of use of the consideration
received by Entropy Foundation for assigning Entropy Tokens.
6.3 Entropy Tokens carry no right to or other legal interest in Entropy Foundation, Hut34 or the right
to control or to be compensated for any decision by Entropy Foundation with respect to its
business, its use of its funds or its decisions if and how to develop Hut34.
7. Obligations of Applicant for Token Sale
7.1 Applicant is solely responsible for determining if they can legally participate in the Token Sale
and receive and hold Entropy Tokens, including but not limited to whether Applicant’s
participation in the Token Sale is subject to the laws of Applicant’s jurisdiction or other laws
applying to Applicant. No refund or other compensation will be given if Applicant or an Entropy
Token Owner later claims they were not entitled to, or were prohibited from, participating in the
Token Sale, including but not limited to applying for, being assigned or acquiring control over
Entropy Tokens. The contract for allocating Entropy Tokens will not be fundamentally breached
by any such asserted legal incapacity.
7.2 Applicant is solely responsible for ensuring the validity of all of their blockchain payments to
Entropy Foundation in the Token Sale.
7.3 Applicant is solely responsible for assessing the risks of participating in the Token Sale, HUT34,
Entropy Tokens and the role of Entropy Foundation.
(a) Applicant must make that assessment without relying on any version of any Whitepaper
or TDS. While Entropy Foundation publishes Whitepapers, TDSs and other documents
from time to time, those documents are not represented as, and may not be taken as,
being complete or exhaustive in disclosing features and risks of Entropy Tokens and
HUT34 nor can they reasonably be expected to remain current, especially due to HUT34
undergoing development in volatile conditions.
(b) Applicant and each other Entropy Token Owner accepts and acknowledges that any
publications by or on behalf of Entropy Foundation may not be relied upon as
representations, undertakings, assurances or guarantees nor as partial or complete
disclosures of features and risks of the Token Sale, HUT34, Entropy Tokens and Entropy
Foundation.
(c) Applicant and each other Entropy Token Owner is solely responsible for assessing the
features and risks of acquiring Entropy Tokens (independently of, and without any
reliance on, any TDS or Whitepaper).

supplemental instructions given by Entropy Foundation.

Applicant to complete or process any application.

reasonably foreseeable.
14.5 Subject to a Preserved Liability, we are not responsible for any Loss or other liability incurred by
Applicant to the extent arising from us acting or refraining to act within our rights and powers or
if any transaction or process is interrupted, fails to complete or take place due to the failure of
any other person’s website, any email, broadband, telephone, messaging or other electronic
communication service or third party act or omission.
14.6 To the extent permitted by law, only if our liability to Applicant or other Entropy Token Owner is
not limited as expressly set out elsewhere in these Terms, then our aggregate liability to
Applicant under these Terms is limited to the amount Applicant has paid us in the two years
preceding the breach (valued as at the time of payment to us). If it is determined by a court that
by law we are not permitted to disclaim or to limit our liability to Applicant or we are not
permitted to limit the amount of compensation we may be liable for, or any of those limitations
are unenforceable, then those limits are severed from these Terms as though they were not in it
from the beginning of application of these Terms to our relationship with Applicant.
15. Indemnities
15.1 Subject to a Preserved Liability, Applicant indemnifies us against all losses, claims, damages,
costs and expenses (including all reasonable legal expenses actually incurred) or any other
remedies arising directly or indirectly as a result of:
(a) taxes and other government levies or charges imposed on Applicant or transactions
made for Applicant;
(b) Applicant’s breach of these Terms;
(c) Applicant’s breach of any law or regulation;
(d) us acting in accordance with Applicant’s instructions or relying on information given by
Applicant or Applicant’s behalf; and
(e) claims of any kind by any third parties in relation to our obligations under these Terms,
except to the extent the claims, damages, costs and expenses were a result of our negligence,
wilful misconduct or fraud or our breach of these Terms. This provision survives termination of
these Terms, any agreement formed under it and the completion or other end of the Token
Sale.
16. Confidentiality and privacy
16.1 We will keep confidential all of Applicant’s personal information and all other of Applicant’s
confidential information so we will not disclose or use it except if one or more of the following
applies:
(a) as permitted by law, including when compelled by a notice or order properly issued by a
regulatory authority;
(b) as permitted by Applicant; and
(c) in accordance with these Terms or as permitted by our privacy policy from time to time.
16.2 We will make reasonable efforts to keep any such information that we have about Applicant
secure and to ensure that any of our employees or agents who have access to the information
about Applicant do not make any unauthorised use, modification, reproduction or disclosure of
that information.
16.3 We will comply with our privacy policy.
17. General
17.1 To the extent this document conflicts with the Website or any other document, including but not
limited to other Token Sale Documents, these Terms prevail.
17.2 Time is of the essence of performance of a person’s obligations under these Terms. If these
Terms specify when the party must perform an obligation or the last time to preform the
obligation, the party must perform it by the time specified. Each party must perform all other
obligations promptly.
17.3 Applicant must pay or provide to us any amount or other consideration due to us in full, without
deduction or set-off (and irrespective of any counterclaim) whatever.
17.4 A person with a right arising under these Terms (including an Entropy Foundation Person other
than Entropy Foundation) may exercise the right in any way it considers appropriate (including
by imposing conditions), unless these Terms expressly states otherwise. A reference in these
Terms to Entropy Foundation having a right in its absolute discretion includes Entropy
Foundation not being bound to make enquiries or to give reasons.
17.5 A person entitled to a remedy arising under or otherwise in relation to these Terms (including an
Entropy Foundation Person other than Entropy Foundation) may exercise the remedy in any
way it considers appropriate.
17.6 A person whose consent is required under these Terms (including an Entropy Foundation
Person other than Entropy Foundation) may refuse its consent without having to give reasons
for that or offer its consent in any way it considers appropriate (including by imposing
conditions), unless these Terms expressly states otherwise.
17.7 If a person with the benefit of these Terms does not exercise a right or remedy fully or at a given
time, the party may still exercise it later.
17.8 A person is not liable for loss caused by the exercise or attempted exercise of, failure to
exercise, or delay in exercising, a right or remedy however they arise under or in relation to
these Terms.
17.9 By giving its approval or consent, a person does not make or give any warranty or
representation as to any circumstance relating to the subject matter of the consent or approval.
17.10 The rights and remedies provided in these Terms are in addition to other rights and remedies
given by law independently of these Terms.
17.11 The indemnities and rights to be reimbursed arising under these Terms are continuing
obligations, independent from the other obligations of persons arising under these Terms and
continue after the Token Sale ends. It is not necessary for a person to incur expense or make
payment before enforcing a right of indemnity or reimbursement arising under or in relation to
these Terms.
17.12 All notices must be in English. Unless otherwise specified or agreed, all notices may be given
by a person to the other in writing by email or by other electronic communication service
acceptable to is (including through our Website).
17.13 Nothing in the Token Sale or otherwise arising under the Terms may be taken as giving rise to a
relationship of employment, joint venture or partnership nor as to any agency or fiduciary
relationships.
17.14 Failure or neglect by a person to enforce any of the provisions of these Terms must not be
construed as, nor may be deemed to be, a waiver of their rights arising under these Terms nor
prejudice their rights to take subsequent action.
17.15 We only recognise one person as an Applicant or as an Entropy Token Owner. Any application
made in the name of two or more persons cannot be accepted.
17.16 Applicant may not assign any agreement arising from the Token Sale or these Terms, because
it is personal to Applicant. This clause has no effect on the nature or transferability of Entropy
Tokens.
17.17 These Terms set out the only terms for the Token Sale. An agreement for sale of Entropy
Tokens may only arise under these Terms. There may not be any other agreement between
Applicant and Entropy Foundation (or any other Entropy Foundation Person) in relation to your
participation in the Token Sale and being assigned, controlling and holding Entropy Tokens.
17.18 We may amend these Terms by publication of new Terms on our Website.
(a) Entropy Foundation will not give any other notice of the amendments. Such amendments
will be effective immediately upon publication on the Website, whether or not you have
read the amendments or are aware of them.
(b) The latest version of these Terms will automatically apply to all applications which have
not been settled by creation of the Entropy Tokens for them.
(c) If we determine that the amendment may adversely affect applicants for Entropy Tokens
as a whole (without taking into account any particular applicant), we may in our absolute
discretion make arrangements which we decide are reasonable for allowing applicants to
withdraw from the Token Sale.
(d) We will not be liable for any Loss arising out of any amendment of the Terms or any
withdrawal by Applicant.
(e) Entropy Foundation will only amend these Terms for one or more of these
purposes: if it believes it is reasonable for clarifying any aspect of these
Terms; to facilitate the proper conduct of the Token Sale; to manage legal or
taxation requirements (including to respond to a change in law or a policy for
administering a law); and to prevent or to minimise unlawful conduct.
17.19 If any term or other provision of these Terms is held by a court to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable under the applicable law, then that term or provision is to be interpreted as being
severed from these Terms and the remaining Terms will be unaffected by that.
